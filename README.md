# Write your dissertation in Rmarkdown

This repository contains the files necessary to complete the Coding Club write your dissertation in Rmarkdown tutorial - you can check it out at: https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/rmarkdown-dissertation/

The `data` folder contains a sample dataset called `puffins_temp.csv`. The dataset presents climate data (tmin and tmax), released by the [International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) Release 3, Monthly Summaries](https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds548.1/) and population trends of *Fratercula arctica* species (Atlantic puffins), collected as part of the [Seabird Monitroing Programme](http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-1550). 

Citation and redistribution information for the climate data is specified in this [document.](https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds548.1/docs/R3.0-citation.pdf)  
Note: Access to dataset requires registration.

Seabird data is avaiable for thrid party use. The data is licensed under a JNCC specific Data Policy which can be found [here](http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/pdf/SMP_DataAccessPolicy.pdf). The specific requirements for using this data are listed under ANNEX 3 in this [document.](http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/pdf/SMP%20Statement%20of%20Intent%20-%20final.pdf)

The `img` folder contains an image of the University Of Edinburgh logo, used in the tutorial for practicing with creating the front page of the dissertation template.

All the `.Rmd` files here correspond to the different sections of the dissertation, which are going to be merged together during the tutorial to create the complete dissertation structure. 

`bibliography.bib` contains sample references on *Fratercula arctica* (Atlantic puffins), written in `BibTex` format.
